UIImage+Color
=======================

Category for UIImage to colorize it. Perfect for changing the color of a glyph with a neutral color.

To use simply invoke with -

```objective-c
    _imageView.image = [_disclosureImage changeColor:[UIColor greenColor]];
```

Supports both retina and regular display scales.

Done.

This snippet has been floating around in one form or another. I've updated it accordingly for retina. Keen to attribute it to the original owner.
